This approach helps create visually appealing, balanced, and cohesive designs that guide users’ eyes where they need to go. Here’s how it works:\n\n🔹 60% Primary Color: Sets the overall tone and covers large areas, like backgrounds or primary components. This main color serves as the foundation of the design.\n\n🔹 30% Secondary Color: Adds contrast and brings interest without overwhelming the dominant color. Think menus, buttons, or secondary elements.\n\n🔹 10% Accent Color: The attention-grabber. Used sparingly, this color highlights crucial elements like call-to-action buttons or icons, guiding users to key interactions.\n\nBy following this rule, you create a design that feels both structured and engaging, ensuring a smooth user experience that doesn’t overwhelm the eye. Want your UI to stand out? Let the 60-30-10 rule lead the way!\n\nPlease LIKE, REPOST or SHARE if you find this insightful ✨\n\nFollow me for daily insights and the latest trends in Product Design, straight to your feed! ❤️",

      "text": "Is the Role of Wireframes Still Vital in 2024?\n\nThe answer is...\n\nYes, wireframes are still used for creating the foundation of a design. Here’s why:\n\n• Clear Structure: They provide a simplified layout, allowing designers to focus on the basic structure and flow.\n\n• Focus on Usability: Wireframes emphasize user interaction and functionality before getting into visual details like colors or fonts.\n\n• Efficient Communication: They help communicate ideas clearly between designers, developers, and stakeholders.\n\n• Faster Iteration: It’s easier to make changes at the wireframe stage, saving time during the later design phases.\n\n• Better Problem Solving: Wireframes help identify potential design and usability issues early in the process.\n\nHowever, with the rise of design tools that allow rapid prototyping, some designers may skip traditional wireframing and jump straight into high-fidelity mockups or interactive prototypes. It depends on the project, timeline, and the team's workflow. But overall, wireframes remain an effective way to ensure the design's foundation is solid before diving into the more polished stages.\n\n🏆 Pro tips: if your project time period is not long enough, you can create the wireframes for important pages (eg. landing page) & skip it for less important pages (eg. notification page).\n\n📌 What's the impact of wireframes in your design journey?

          "text": "Everything You Need to Know About Customer Experience (CX) 🧐\n\nWhat is CX?\n\nCX or Customer Experience is the overall perception customers have of a brand through their entire journey—from initial awareness to post-purchase interactions. It's about how customers feel at every touchpoint with a brand, whether they're browsing the website, contacting support, or interacting on social media. Here are some key elements of CX:\n\n• Customer satisfaction: How satisfied customers are with a product or service.\n\n• Customer relationship management (CRM): How a company interacts with customers.\n\n• Emotional Connection: What customers feel after interacting with your brand.\n\n• Feedback: Creating effective channels for customers to share their thoughts.\n\n• Personalization: Does the brand feel tailored to each customer?\n\nWhat is the Relation Between CX and UX?\n\nUX or User Experience is a core part of CX. While CX covers the full customer journey, UX focuses specifically on user interaction with a product or service. A great UX within a product makes a positive contribution to the overall CX, but CX goes beyond that, involving support, brand engagement, and customer satisfaction.\n\nGreat CX is built on more than just a great product; it’s about consistent, meaningful interactions that make customers feel valued and understood. Invest in both UX design and CX strategy to create memorable, loyal customer relationships.\n\n💬 What does CX mean for you?
