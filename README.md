### Stage 1: Content Analysis
- **Ingests LinkedIn posts in JSON format**: The system takes in raw LinkedIn posts provided in JSON format.
- **Extracts metadata**: It extracts important metadata such as topics, language, length, and engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares).
- **Processes and unifies content tags**: The tool processes the content to identify and unify tags for better categorization. For example, tags like "Jobseekers" and "Job Hunting" are unified under "Job Search".
- **Stores processed data**: The processed data, including the extracted metadata and unified tags, is stored in a structured format for efficient retrieval during content generation.

### Stage 2: Content Generation
- **Utilizes few-shot learning with filtered relevant examples**: The system uses few-shot learning, leveraging a small number of relevant examples to guide the AI in generating new content.
- **Considers post length, language, and topic preferences**: The AI takes into account the desired post length (Short, Medium, Long), language (English, Hinglish), and topic preferences to tailor the generated content.
- **Maintains consistent tone and style through AI prompting**: The AI is prompted to maintain a consistent tone and style that matches the user's previous posts, ensuring authenticity.
- **Generates engaging content with optimal formatting**: The final output is engaging, well-formatted content that aligns with the user's style and preferences.
